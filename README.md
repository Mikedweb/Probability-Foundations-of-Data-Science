# Probability-Foundations-of-Data-Science
Understanding conditional probability and Bayes Theorem, this course will provide you with all you need to begin making accurate predictions. Finally, you will apply your knowledge by building a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier that predicts whether or not a flight will arrive on time using a set of real-world data.
